This project demonstrates how to use external stylesheets with Web Components, without the problem of [flashes of unstyled content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content).

[Read the article](https://jbanes.github.io/WebComponentStylesheets/article.html) for a full explanation of what's going on.

If you wish to examine a working example, look at [Example 5](https://github.com/jbanes/WebComponentStylesheets/tree/main/example5). You can [view it as a webpage](https://jbanes.github.io/WebComponentStylesheets/example5/index.html) to see it in action.
