        <h1>Making Web Components Fun to Develop</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Web Components are the latest breakthrough in web development. 
            Developers can create reusable custom elements using standard 
            Javascript and HTML. Sophisticated web applications can then 
            be built out of straightforward and concise HTML documents.</p>
            <p>If successful, Web Components could finally close the gap
            between writing highly dynamic Javascript and HTML as a 
            static document.</p>
            <p>There's just one problem: <b>Styling</b></p>
            <p>In this article we're going to solve that problem. Fully and completely.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>The Problem with Stylesheets</h2>
            <p>Web Components typically use a Shadow DOM to encapsulate all of
            the HTML they generate. The Shadow DOM behaves a bit like an 
            <code>iframe</code>, with an entire hierarchy of elements completely
            separated from the main page. The only real difference is that an
            <code>iframe</code> constrains the rendering to a scrollable area
            while Web Components are embedded in the layout of the parent page.</p>
            <p>One feature that the Shadow DOM shares with <code>iframe</code> is
            that the styling of the parent page cannot affect the component.</p>
            <p>On the surface this sounds great! The component is completely 
            separated with no chance of user stying mucking up your carefully
            designed component. Except... Web Components are just Javascript 
            classes. How the heck are <i>you</i> supposed to style it?</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Styling Web Components</h2>
            <p>When we look at most Web Components, we see typically code like this:</p>
            <code-highlight type="javascript">
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <code>this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = "&lt;style> " +
                            "button { " +
                            "    background: #1E88E5; " +
                            "    color: white; " +
                            "    padding: 2rem 4rem; " +
                            "    border: 0; font-size: 1.5rem; " +
                            "}" +
                            "&lt;/style>" +
                            "&lt;button>Sup?&lt;/button>";</code>
            </code-highlight>
            <p>This code works, but has a few key problems. For one, this is 
            rather painful to develop. Who wants to be hacking at a string inside
            their Javascript with no LSP support?</p>
            <p>Perhaps more glaringly, what happens when you want to change the
            theme of the component in the wild? Pretty much every component technology
            going all the back to jQuery UI provided theming!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="image3">
            <img src="images/themerollergreen.png" alt="Green theme">
            <img src="images/themerollerblue.png" alt="Blue theme">
            <img src="images/themerollerorange.png" alt="Orange theme">
            <div>Green Theme</div>
            <div>Blue Theme</div>
            <div>Orange Theme</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Themes are important in professional work as they carry brand 
            identity and help integrate the component into the overall UX design
            of the application. Any component that can't be themed is already
            dead on arrival.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>But What if I Want Stylesheets?</h2>
            <p>There's a great <a href="https://css-tricks.com/styling-a-web-component/">article</a>
            over on CSS Tricks that discusses the various workarounds. Some of 
            them are quite decent (e.g. using global CSS variables), but none
            of them really get us to what we want: The ability to inject inline
            styles in our HTML and/or link to an external stylesheet of our
            choosing.</p>
            <p>To accomplish that, we're going to have to get a bit clever.</p>
            <p>For the rest of this article, I'm going to show you how to link
            arbitrary styling information into Web Components. <i>Without</i> 
            causing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content">Flashes
            of Unstyled Content</a> (FOUC).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Understanding our Goals</h2>
            <p>To see how it's done we're going to create a very simple Web 
            Component that places a styled button on the screen. And then we're 
            going to see how to link our stylesheet into it.</p>
            <p>Let's start by looking at a page with the all the necessary HTML 
            and CSS fully embedded. That way we can see what results we want to
            achive.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <code-viewer>
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <files root="example1" render="index.html">
                    <file>index.html</file>
                </files>
            </code-viewer>
        </div>
        <div class="figure">Example 1: Pure HTML with embedded style</div>
        <div>
            <p>As you can see, we have a large blue button on top of a white
            field, with an antique white background behind that. If there is 
            any delay in the style being applied, the button will appear to
            flash during rendering as the button recolors to blue and the
            white area is expanded to accomodate the larger button size.</p>
            <p>You can click the "Open" button to view the page directly. Try
            refreshing the page a few times to see if there is any flashing.
            Since our style is defined prior to the button's definition, you
            should see a completely stable interface with no flashes during
            refreshes.</p>
            <p>Now let's embed our button into a Web Component:</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <code-viewer>
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <files root="example2" render="index.html">
                    <file>index.html</file>
                    <file>mybutton.js</file>
                </files>
            </code-viewer>
        </div>
        <div class="figure">Example 2: Web Component with no style</div>
        <div>
            <p>As you can see, we have some nice, clean Javascript with no 
            stringified stylesheets uglifying our code. That's the good news.</p>
            <p>Bad news is that we've lost all style on our button. You can see
            that the styles are still there (line 15 of <code>mybutton.js</code>), 
            but the <code>.thicc</code> style is never getting applied. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Applying a Stylesheet to our Web Component</h2>
            <p>Take a look at the following code:</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <code-viewer>
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <files root="example3" render="index.html">
                    <file>index.html</file>
                    <file>mybutton.js</file>
                </files>
            </code-viewer>
        </div>
        <div class="figure">Example 3: Web Component with style element</div>
        <div>
            <p>A couple things probably stand out right off the bat.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Our button is once again styled</li>
                <li>A <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag is embedded inside the
                <code>&lt;my-button&gt;</code> Web Component tag</li>
                <li>There's still no CSS in the Javascript!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>WAIT! Before you run off thinking you understand the solution,
            it's a bit more complicated than just putting the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
            tag into the Web Component element. All we did was make the style 
            avaialble to the Web Component. It still won't apply without some
            additional magic.</p>
            <p>In fact, we have to be careful here. The <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
            tag inside the element can still affect the rest of the page. This
            can cause a Flash of Unstyled Content until our component has fully
            consumed it.</p>
            <p>The real magic is happening on lines 15-20 of the Javascript. Here
            we are looping through the elements contained within the element in
            the primary DOM, looking for the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element,
            then moving that element from the primary DOM into the Shadow DOM.</p>
            <code-highlight type="javascript" start="15">
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <code>        this.childNodes.forEach(function(element) {
            if(element.nodeName === "STYLE")
            {
                shadow.appendChild(element);
            }
        });</code>
            </code-highlight>
            <p>If you were to inspect the page, you'll find that the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
            element has disappeared from the element itself and now resides at the
            top of the Shadow DOM. The code then adds the button after the style
            element is moved.</p>
            <p>However, we're not done yet. If you try to apply this to your own Web
            Component, it will likely not work. It's only working here because of 
            line 7 of the HTML:</p>
            <code-highlight type="HTML" start="7">
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <code>        &lt;script src="mybutton.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
            </code-highlight>
            <p>See that <code>defer</code> there? That's telling the browser not 
            to load the script until the page is done loading. Without this, the
            element would have no children when <code>connectedCallback()</code>
            is called by the browser to let us know that our element has been
            added. Using <code>defer</code> allows us to attach to the element
            after all of its contents have been attached.</p>
            <p>In my testing, this will work in Chrome without a Flash of Unstyled
            Content. Chrome will complete the load of the script before it attempts
            to render to the screen.</p>
            <p>However, other browser are not so generous. If you click the Open
            button in Safari and hit Refresh a times, you're going to notice a 
            small flash. It's not bad and can be worked around in the parent
            document, but we can do better.</p>
            <p>Let's look at how we can more completely solve this issue.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Tangent: Why Not Use Slot for Style?</h2>
            <p>Before we dive any deeper, I want to answer a question some of 
            you might have at this point. If you've studied Web Components at
            all, you might be wondering why we can't just use a <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>
            to pull int the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag?</p>
            <p>And that's actually a really good question! For those who are 
            unfamiliar, a Web Component can have a tag like this:</p>
            <code-highlight type="javascript">
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <code>this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = '&lt;button&gt;&lt;slot name="my_slot"&gt;Default Text&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/button&gt;';</code>
            </code-highlight>
            <p>...and then you can "slot" in content like this:</p>
            <code-highlight type="HTML">
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <code>&lt;my-button&gt;    
    &lt;span slot="my_slot"&gt;Click Me!&lt;/slot&gt;
&lt;/my-button&gt;</code>
            </code-highlight>
            <p>When this code runs, the <i>Click Me!</i> would be rendered instead of 
            <i>Default Text</i>. The content we provided literally "slots" into the
            <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tag we provided.</p>
            <p>The problem is that the slotted content never enters the Shadow
            DOM. This is a technique known as "Light DOM". The Light DOM entries
            stay part of the parent DOM and are affected by styling in the parent
            DOM. What happens is that when the browser goes to render the slot, it
            looks aside to the slotted content and renders that from the parent
            DOM as if it were positioned in the Shadow DOM.</p>
            <p>The end result is that the content is rendered as part of the
            Shadow DOM, but the content is otherwise unable to interact with the
            Shadown DOM.</p>
            <p>What this means for a slotted <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag is
            simple: The <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag doesn't render anything. So
            there will be no useful interactions in the chosen slot. We'll have
            to look back to moving elements into the Shadow DOM if we want our
            styling to take effect.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Eliminating Flashes of Unstyled Content</h2>
            <p>We have a technique for pulling our style into the Shadow DOM. The
            only problem is that this happens after the page has fully loaded.
            Ideally, we'd like to be able to render our tag as soon as the tag
            content is loaded.</p>
            <p>Thankfully, there is an easy way to accomplish this.</p>
            <p>We can register a <code>MutationObserver</code> to be notified
            as soon as the <code>childNodes</code> are avaialble.</p>
            <p>The code pattern looks like this:</p>
            <code-highlight type="javascript" start="39">
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <code>        var observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) {
            // Call a function to build your Web Component UI
         });

        observer.observe(this, {attributes: false, childList: true, characterData: false, subtree: false});</code>
            </code-highlight>
            <p>We can easily plop this into our component:</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <code-viewer>
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <files root="example4" render="index.html">
                    <file>index.html</file>
                    <file>mybutton.js</file>
                </files>

        <div class="figure">Example 4: Fix for flash of unstyled content</div>
        <div>
            <p>As you can see, we've moved the rendering from <code>connectedCallback()</code>
            to <code>#attachElements()</code>. The <code>#attachElements()</code> 
            method is called twice. Once in <code>connectedCallback()</code> in
            case the Web Component has been invoked late in the page's rendering.</p>
            <p>The <code>#attachElements()</code> call checks if elements and
            attributes are available before attempting to render, so it's safe
            to call before any attributes or elements are attached.</p>
            <p>The second call is in the <code>MutationObserver</code> which is
            triggered at the very end of the <code>childNodes</code> load. If the
            Web Component is loaded at the beginning of the page (e.g. in the
            <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>), this will trigger as soon as the custom
            element is fully loaded.</p>
            <p>Go ahead and click Open, then refresh the page a few times. No
            flashes!</p>
            <p>This is because our updates are happening during the initial render
            of the page. Around the exact time we want the updates to happen: as
            soon as the HTML parser is done loading our tag.</p>
            <p>Ok, we've fully solved styling, right? Not so fast. So far we've
            been working with embedded stylesheets. That's not really ideal, 
            especially if we have multiple uses of the same component. How do
            we link in an external stylesheet?</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Linking External Stylesheets</h2>
            <p>So far we've been using embedded stylesheets. This is nice for 
            a demonstration, but how do we link to an external stylesheet? Importantly,
            how do we link to an external stylesheet without a Flash of Unstyled
            content caused by the stylesheet loading after the page loads?</p>
            <p>The answer is thankfully as simple as our handlng of the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> 
            tag. If we place a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in our element and then
            move it to our Shadow DOM, something magical happens.</p>
            <p>When the browser encounters the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag, it
            immediately loads the stylesheet to prevent unstyled content.</p>
            <p>Our <code>MutationObserver</code> then triggers at the end of the tag 
            load. The code moves the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to the
            Shadow DOM.</p>
            <p>Because the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLinkElement">HTMLLinkElement</a> 
            has already loaded the the stylesheet, no additional load occurs and 
            the styles are immediately applied to the Shadow DOM.</p>
            <p>This is exactly what we want.</p>

                <files root="example5" render="index.html">
                    <file>index.html</file>
                    <file>mybutton.js</file>
                    <file>mybutton.css</file>

        <div class="figure">Example 5: External link to stylesheet</div>
        <div>
            <p>If you click the "Open" button above and refresh the page a few
            times, you'll notice that the rendering is solid. No unexpected 
            flashes.</p>
            <p>It is possible to click so fast that you cancel the load partway
            and cause an incomplete page to be briefly shown. This is entirely
            caused by clicking the refresh button too fast and not something
            we'll see in normal page loads. If you fully wait for the page to
            load before hitting refresh, no flashes should be visible.</p>
            <p>The only change needed was to add "LINK" to line 25
            of the Javascript:</p>
            <code-highlight type="javascript" start="25">
                <link href="css/codeviewer.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                <code>    this.childNodes.forEach(function(element) {
        if(element.nodeName === "STYLE" || element.nodeName === "LINK")
        {
            mybutton.#shadow.appendChild(element);
        }
    });</code>
            </code-highlight>
            <p>Don't worry about multiple components using the same stylesheet.
            The browser already takes care of that for you. If you request the
            same stylesheet multiple times, the browser will pull it from cache
            to speed up rendering. The end result is that your stylesheet will
            only load once, even if multiple Shadow DOMs are using it.</p>
            <p>And that's it! We now have a method of setting our CSS stylesheet
            independent of our Javascript, allowing for rapid creation of components
            without getting bogged down in the difficulties of embedding styles.</p>
            <p>Even better, we now have a mechanism for allowing users of our 
            components to re-theme them as needed!</p>
